This project implements a complete Machine Learning workflow to predict diabetic patient readmission risk within 30 days using an XGBoost Classifier.
The process is divided into two distinct parts:
  Training (training.py): Data preparation, pipeline construction, model training, and artifact saving.
  Deployment (app.py): Serving the trained model as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
